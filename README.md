# PowerBi-TOEFL Scores Analysis for UPMH

## Power BI Dashboard

### Overview

This project utilizes TOEFL scores data from 2015 to 2019 to analyze the improvement in skills such as listening, reading, and writing comprehension. The dashboard allows users to filter by specific years and genders, and compare the scores against the average score in the whole country and the global average.

### Data Sources

The data for this project was sourced from the TOEFL institution and the Universidad Politecnica Metropolitana de Hidalgo (UPMH). The data is historical and does not contain any sensitive information.

### Dashboard Structure


The dashboard consists of two main pages:

1. **Main Page**: This page contains three dynamic visuals that display information from the selected year (2019 by default). The visuals include an average score display, a bar chart, and a line chart that also shows the average world score and the country's score. There are slicers for year and gender, and a button to clear selections. A tooltip provides information about the MCER levels (A1, A2, B1, etc).

2. **Skills Detail Page**: This page provides a detailed analysis of the skills, identifying the best and worst-performing skills. It includes average scores by skill (reading, writing, listening) and standard deviation scores, with explanatory text. Three scatter plot visuals show the distribution of TOEFL test scores, indicating a concentration of students in the lower score bracket.

### How to Use

On the main page, use the slicers to filter by year and gender. The visuals will update dynamically based on your selections. You can clear your selections using the button provided. On the second page, the slicers also apply, and you can view detailed information about each skill.
